# ProfitCalculator
This calculator will display the total costs, fees, and profits of items you are purchasing to sell on Amazon/eBay. This also includes a local database.

This calculate will take data from a user and generate the exact profits they will obtain from selling items on eBay/Amazon. 

Currently trying to get the chart to update with new data but only the new product name will appear.
